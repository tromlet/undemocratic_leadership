  <h1>List of Undemocratic Leaders</h1>
  <p>This is a list of elected officials or other prominent, public-facing leaders in the United States who have endorsed or acted in service to Donald Trump's efforts to subvert the outcome of November 2020 General Election.</p>
  <p>This is not intended to be a list of EVERYONE who supported legal challenges, recounts, etc. Among reasonable people, there is obviously SOME recourse available to losing candidates to ensure the integrity of the election, and thus, their loss. I still need to flesh out what <em>specific</em> actions and thresholds qualify an individual for being placed on this list - this will likely be determined by precedent (e.g. Al Gore's November 2000 loss, etc), but suggestions welcome.</p>
